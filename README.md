# metaboolizer
Password generator using SHA-256 hashing algorithm. (Python)

Cross-platform (Windows, MacOS, Android, iOS, GNU/Linux), using Kivy Framework.

The program uniquely generates a password of choosable length, starting from a master key and the name of the service for which the password 
  is being generated. This is intended to be used in order to have a different strong password for every account, but without
  having to remember them all. In fact, you'll only have to remember the master key.
  The program will not store the master key, nor the different generated passwords.
